# iCitizen

iCitizen is meant to be used as a legal reference tool. The application will 
offer steps by step instructions meant to help the user navigate common interactions
they might have with law enforment.

- The app currently implements the a gps fucntion that takes your exact coordinates and
converts it into a human friendly location label

- As of now only traffic stops, pedestrian stops, and home visits are covered in the
guided steps

- The application is structured in a template format. As more content is generated it 
can just be populated into the program
